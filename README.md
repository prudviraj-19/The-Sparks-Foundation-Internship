# Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks
## Task 1:- Prediction using Supervised ML

(Level - Beginner)

- Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of
study hours
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
- You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool
- Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
- What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
- Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/2HxiGGJ
- Task submission:
1. Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and output
in a video. Post the video on YouTube
2. Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on YOUR
LinkedIn profile
3. Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared with you.

## Task 2:- Prediction using Unsupervised ML

(Level - Beginner)

- From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and
represent it visually.
- Use R or Python or perform this task
- Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
- Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j
- Task submission:
1. Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and output in
a video. Post the video on YouTube
2. Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on YOUR
LinkedIn profile
3. Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared with you.

## Task 3:- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

(Level - Intermediate)

- For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it
graphically.
- The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.
- Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
- Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/2G6sYx9
- Task submission:
1. Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and output in
a video. Post the video on YouTube
2. Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on YOUR LinkedIn
profile
3. Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared with you.

## Task 4:- Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

(Level - Advanced)

- Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using
numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis
of news headlines
- Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
- Download historical stock prices from https://finance.yahoo.com
- Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
- Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then
combine the findings to create a hybrid model
- Depending on the accuracy of the model and quality of the task, we
will endorse your work and help you publish it.
